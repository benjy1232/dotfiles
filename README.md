# My Dotfiles
Dotfiles for my sway rice. Colorscheme is provided by [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin). Currently using Catppuccin Mocha wherever possible.

Most notable thing in here is most likely [scripts/sway_setup_displays](scripts/sway_setup_displays). Takes advantage of the sway-ipc to determine if the laptop is currently connected to an external monitor, and if it is, disable the internal display.

Editors:
1. Neovim

- WM: sway
- Status Bar: waybar
- Colorscheme: Catppuccin
